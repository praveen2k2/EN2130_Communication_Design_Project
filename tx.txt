GNU Radio is a free software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software-defined radios and signal processing systems. 
It can be used with external radio frequency (RF) hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. 
It is widely used in hobbyist, academic, and commercial environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.
